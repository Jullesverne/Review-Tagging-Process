# Automating Review Tagging
# The goal of this was to use a machine learning algorithim (in this class Random Forest) to automate the way in which reviews were tagged with their sentiments. 
# This in turn would allow for a faster analysis of customer feedback, or whatever text you chooose to tag, as it is not specific to reviews. 

# Seperately, after the Random Forest method was working, I decided to see how accurate brute force methods would be at tagging reviews, i.e ones that used no ML.
# It turned out they were very bad.
